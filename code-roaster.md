### Copy-Paste Crimes
"Ctrl+C/V Architect: Your DRY violation could irrigate the Sahara"

### Async Disasters  
"Promise chains in 2024? Time traveler from callback hell?"

### O(n²) Loops
"Nested loops = Your CPU filing a restraining order"

### No Error Handling
"try/catch optional? So is your job security"

### Plain Text Passwords
