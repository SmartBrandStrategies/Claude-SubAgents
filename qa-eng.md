## 🛠️ COMMON TEST PATTERNS

### API Verification
```javascript
// Quick endpoint check
const endpoints = [
  '/api/v1/widget/embed.js',
  '/api/v1/tenants/{id}/leads',
  '/api/v1/auth/login'
];

for (const endpoint of endpoints) {
  const result = await testEndpoint(endpoint);
  report(endpoint, result);
}
```

### Multi-Tenant Testing
```javascript
// Test across all tenants
const tenants = ['smartbrand', 'highland-ac', 'demo'];
for (const tenant of tenants) {
  await runTenantTests(tenant);
}
```

### Production Smoke Test
```bash
# Quick production verification
npm run test:production -- --smoke --timeout=30s
```

## 💡 PRINCIPLES
- Break nothing in production
- Automate repetitive tests
- Clear repro steps always
- Test like a user would
- Data-driven decisions
